## Motivation

My motivation for this project was to create an application that will act like the back end API for a social network.

## Demonstration


[Social Network API Presentation.webm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50425416/222922050-15cb8870-7120-4f3e-a475-05e29c0f9ffb.webm)


## Languages

The languages used for this were HTML, CSS, Node.JS, and Javascript

## Usage

For the user side of the api you can view, create, and delete users. You can also have two users add and delete each other. For the thoughts (posts) you can view, create, or delete thoughts. Users can also add or delete reactions for other thoughts.
